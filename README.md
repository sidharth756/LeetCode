# LeetCode Solutions

## Introduction

Welcome to this repository! This collection houses a variety of solutions to LeetCode problems, meticulously organized to help you hone your coding skills. Whether you're preparing for technical interviews, aiming to deepen your understanding of algorithms and data structures, or simply enjoy the challenge of problem-solving, you'll find valuable resources here. Our primary goal is to provide a clear and accessible platform for learning and practice.

## How to Use This Repository

Navigating this repository is straightforward. Each LeetCode problem is organized into its own dedicated directory, named according to its LeetCode problem number and title (e.g., `0001-two-sum/`).

Inside each problem's directory, you will typically find:
*   **Solution Code**: A file containing the solution, often named after the problem or a generic name like `solution.cpp` or `solution.py`.
*   **Problem Description**: A `README.md` file within the problem's directory that includes the problem statement, any specific notes, constraints, and sometimes a brief explanation of the approach taken.

To find a specific problem, you can either:
1.  Use the GitHub search bar within this repository.
2.  Browse the directory structure directly. The LeetCode problem number in the directory name should make it easy to locate.
3.  Refer to the "LeetCode Topics" section in this main README, which lists problems categorized by common algorithmic themes and links directly to their respective directories.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are highly encouraged and appreciated! Whether you're a seasoned coder or just starting out, your input can help make this resource even better.

We welcome various types of contributions, including but not limited to:
*   **New Solutions**: Adding solutions to problems not yet covered, or providing solutions in different programming languages.
*   **Improvements to Existing Solutions**: Optimizing current solutions for better performance or clarity.
*   **Bug Fixes**: Correcting any errors in existing solutions or problem descriptions.
*   **Documentation Enhancements**: Improving the clarity of problem descriptions, adding explanations of solution approaches, or enhancing this main README.
*   **Adding Test Cases**: While not a primary feature yet, if you add a new solution, consider including a simple way to test it or describe test cases in the problem's `README.md`.

**General Contribution Guidelines:**
1.  **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking this repository to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Create a New Branch**: For each new problem or significant change, create a new branch in your forked repository. Name it descriptively (e.g., `add-solution-0002-add-two-numbers` or `improve-readme-contributing-section`).
3.  **Make Your Changes**: Implement your solution, fix the bug, or enhance the documentation. Ensure your code is well-commented and follows any existing style patterns if applicable. If you're adding a new problem, please try to follow the existing directory structure.
4.  **Update Documentation**: If you're adding a new problem solution, create a `README.md` within its directory including the problem description. If you're modifying an existing solution, update its `README.md` if necessary.
5.  **Submit a Pull Request**: Once you're happy with your changes, submit a pull request from your branch to the main branch of this repository. Provide a clear description of the changes you've made.

We'll review your pull request as soon as possible. Thank you for helping to grow this collection!
